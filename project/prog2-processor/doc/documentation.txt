File Processor Documentation

Download/Use Instructions: After downloading this project from github, make sure
to run this program from the prog2-processor directory, using the command 
'java src/fileProcessor.java'

This program, at its core, will read 10K files from Unity and Tupperware, and 
allow you to talk to the chatbot to get information about the two companies. It 
will return the relevant text from the Edgar 10K filings from the two companies.

After running, you ask the chatbot questions about the two companies. In your 
question, make sure to include a company name. If both company names are given, 
the default company is Unity.

Currently, the only information that has been implemented is from Part I of the
company's 10K file. Implementation of the other parts is possible, but only info
from Part I of the 10K is necessary to show the program's functionality.

The output will have the information from the table of contents, as well as the
information from the section. This could be avoided, but I think the header
it gives improves the output.

If you only input is the company and no other information, then it will tell you 
what you can ask about the companies.

After running the program, the results will both be written in a text file named 
'output.txt', found in the "data" folder.

Sample inputs and outputs can be found in the text document in the doc folder.
