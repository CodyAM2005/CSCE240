File Reader Documentation

This program, at its core, will read 10K files from Unity and Tupperware, and give you some statistics in return.
The statistics that it returns is the number of words, lines, characters, and parts. Parts, as I used them, is each
"Part" given in the 'table of contents' section of the 10K.

When using this program, you first have to input either a 1 or a 2 into the console, 1 reading the most recent 
10K from Unity, and 2 reading the most recent 10K from Tupperware.

After writing either 1 or 2 into the console, then you are ready to run the program. The program will prompt you to 
either input a 1 or a 2. After running the program, the results will both be printed in the terminal, and in the 
corresponding output file, found in the "data" folder. The Unity statistics output can be found in the data folder
under 'unity10kstats.txt', while the Tupperware statistics output can be found in the data folder under 
'tupperware10kstats.txt'.

Sample inputs and outputs can be found in the 'test' folder.
