Session Logger

Download/Use Instructions: After downloading this project from github, make sure
to run this program from the prog5-sessionlogger directory, using the commands:

'javac src/chatParser.java src/fileProcessorFE.java src/fileProcessorBE.java' to compile the java files
'java -cp src chatParser' to run the program

This program will read 10k files from Unity and Tupperware, and allow you to talk
to the chatbot to get information about the two companies. It will return the
relevant text from the Edgar 10K filings from the two companies.

Along with that, the program will now log each of the interactions with the
chatbot, and will be able to answer simple commands about the interactions.
These include...

'Summary': Gives a summary of all chats in the system
'Showchat-summary <Chat NO>': Gives a summary of chat specified
'Showchat <Chat NO>': Outputs the chat logs of chat specified
'PA4": Runs the original PA4 program, and also logs new data
'Quit': Quits the program

Sample inputs and outputs can be found in the text document in the doc folder.

Limitations: Organization of the files, having PA4 and PA5 kind of meshed into
one directory could lead to less reusability of the code written.
