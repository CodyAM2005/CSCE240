My Chatbot

Download/Use Instructions: After downloading this project from github, make sure
to run this program from the my-chatbot directory, using the commands:

'javac src/fileParser.java src/chatParser.java src/fileProcessorFE.java src/fileProcessorBE.java' to compile the java files
'java -cp src fileProcessorFE' to run the program

This program will read 10k files from Unity and Tupperware, and allow you to talk
to the chatbot to get information about the two companies. It will return the
relevant text from the Edgar 10K filings from the two companies.

Along with that, the program will now log each of the interactions with the
chatbot, and has simple commands for information access.
These include...

'Companies supported': Gives the companies supported by the chatbot
'Supported info': Gives parts and items supported
'<Company_Name> file stats': Gives the statistics of the company's 10K file
'session-summary': Gives a summary of all chats in the system
'session-chatsummary <Chat NO>': Gives a summary of chat specified
'session-showchat <Chat NO>': Outputs the chat logs of chat specified

Sample inputs and outputs can be found in the text document in the doc folder.

Limitations: Currently, for accurate inputs, the user must input 'tupperware' or
'unity' without any spelling errors, as this will mess up the calculation for
the formula for word match certainty. Another limitation is that because items and
parts are so similar, you have to ask for an item with a number (ie. item 5) and a
part with a roman numeral (ie. part II).
