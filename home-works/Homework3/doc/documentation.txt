Geometric Property Calculator
Version 2.0

This program, at its core, takes shapes with side lengths, and returns either the area of perimeter of these shapes.

When using this program, you first have to input shapes into the "input.txt" file that is in the "data" folder. When 
putting values into the input.txt file, the proper syntax is as follows...

*Each space is a single space, and all calues should be in centimeters*
RECTANGLE <side1> <side2>
CIRCLE <radius>
TRIANGLE <side1> <side2> <side3>

After giving all the shapes you want into the input.txt file, making sure to space them by a new line, then you are
ready to run the program. The program will prompt you to either input a 1 or a 2. A '1' will find the areas of each
shape that was input, and a '2' will find the perimeter of each shape. After typing that into the terminal, the 
results will both be printed in the terminal, and in the output.txt file, found in the "data" folder.

Sample Input: (Option 1)
RECTANGLE 2 3
TRIANGLE 1 0.5 0.5
CIRCLE 1
---------------------------------
Sample Output: (For those inputs)
RECTANGLE AREA: 6
TRIANGLE has a negative or zero area, and is therefore not a valid shape
CIRCLE AREA: 3.14159
